# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
    - It seems very helpful if you need to pull specific information out of an array, or, for example, insert each value from the array into it's on string. Maybe in to personalize something sent out to a list of clients with "Hi "String"
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
    - I need to continuously remind myself that everything seems to build on things we've learned previously. This was also an example of when I need to remember to step away and take a break for a minute. I downloaded an app to try that will set timeres for me.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? Throughout the iteration project, I felt like when I needed to google something I was able to do it quickly and efficiently, because I am getting more used to resources like ruby-docs. I also started using Obsidian to take notes and I think it's going to be incredibly helpful
